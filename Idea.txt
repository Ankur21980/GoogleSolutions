2.The main motto of the project is influence the students of universities to work with us and in return we'll be going to appreciate for their
  participation by providing them badges and certificates.These things will help them in future.

3.Our web app/progressive web app will also have a donation system.The total collected amount will be calculated after a specific period of time.
  And the total amount will be splited into two parts where the 86% of that will distributed among the poors transparently.So, they can use the money to
  start their own business and buy stuffs from small businessman.And the rest of 14% of total amount will be invested in gold, stocks and rael estate for 
  their future purpose by this poor people will also have financial security in bad times.

4.People will be also able to donate their old items and the donated items by the users will be sold at a very reasonable price in consideration of that 
  item to the poor people so that their ego is satisfied and that money will go for the education of the poor children.
